## üìù **Notes**

### 1. Introduction

- Android runs on Java (_used by big companies/games like Minecraft_).
- Java is verbose but enforces good coding practices.
- OOP = Object-Oriented Programming (_core Java paradigm_).

### 2. Context

- The TIOBE Index measures programming language popularity (based on search engine data)
- GitHub publishes annual rankings based on repository usage.
- Stack Overflow generates rankings from developer surveys.
- Java consistently ranks highly in all these metrics.

### 3. History

- Java was created in 1995 by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (_later acquired by Oracle_).

- Java ‚â† JavaScript (_JavaScript borrowed the name for marketing_).

- [Java Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>)

- Kotlin (JetBrains' language) runs on the JVM and can operate with Java.

### 4. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

- WORA ("Write Once, Run Anywhere") talks about Java's cross-platform capabilities.
- Compilation Process:
  - .java gets compiled to bytecode (.class).
  - JVM executes bytecode (each OS has its own JVM).
- Key advantage: Same bytecode runs on any JVM (_Windows, Linux, macOS..._).

### 5. Language's characteristics

- **Strong/static typing:** Variables must declare a fixed type. Types cannot change and this makes the language safer.

- **Garbage Collector:** Automatically frees unused memory so it avoids slowdowns from memory bloating.

### 6. Language's uses
